# Creating Customer Segments with Arvato using Unsupervised Learning Techniques

## Project Overview
This project's goal is to use Unsupervised Learning Machine Learning Techniques to identify customer segments for tailored marketing strategies.

## Files in the Repository
- `Data_Dictionary.md`: Information file about the features in the provided datasets.
- `Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook divided into sections and guidelines for the project.
- `Identify_Customer_Segments.html`: HTML version of the project.

## Executive Summary
In this project, we took 3 major steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Assessed missing data using both the population and feature summary files.
   - Mapped codes for missing or unknown values to specified formats.
   - Visualized missing data rows and columns for upcoming transformation.

2. **Feature Transformation**:
   - Conducted functional data cleaning.
   - Performed feature scaling, additional transformation steps.
   - Applied dimensionality reduction to extract the most important features.

3. **Clustering**:
   - Applied a K-Means algorithm by training and then predicting.
   - Applied all modeling steps to the customer data.
   - Compared both datasets and identified customer segments beneficial for the mail order company.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have all required libraries installed.
3. Open the `Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or your preferred environment.
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.
